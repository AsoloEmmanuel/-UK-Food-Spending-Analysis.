UK Household Food & Drink Spending Analysis (1997‚Äì2022)

Happy new month üéâ  
This project is part of my weekly AI/Data Science practice.


About the project
I took household food and drink spending data from the Office for National Statistics (via Kaggle) and explored how spending has changed between 1997 and 2022.  
I cleaned the data, summed the quarters into yearly totals, checked the averages, highs and lows, made some charts, and even did a simple forecast for 2023 and 2024.


What I did
- Cleaned the dataset and renamed the cryptic codes into proper names.  
- Converted quarterly numbers into yearly totals.  
- Looked at different categories: bread, meat, vegetables, drinks, etc.  
- Made summary stats (mean, min, max, totals).  
- Created line charts, bar charts, and stacked area plots.  
- Added a simple forecast for the next 2 years.  


Findings
- Food spending has kept going up steadily over 25 years.  
- Meat, vegetables, and non-alcoholic drinks take up the biggest share.  
- Sweets and juices are much smaller categories but stayed fairly stable.  
- The forecast shows that spending will keep rising in 2023 and 2024, which matches what we see with today‚Äôs cost of living issues.  


Next steps
Later on I‚Äôd like to:
- Try advanced forecasting models.  
- Compare food spending with inflation and income.  
- Break down results by region or demographics.
